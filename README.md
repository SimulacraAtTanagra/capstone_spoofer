## The purpose of this project is as follows:
This program takes a specific dataset and reverse engineers singular data points from aggregates, with the collection of singular points still having the same statistical profile as the aggregate. 
## Here's some back story on why I needed to build this:
For my Masters Degree capstone project, my team was supplied with aggregate data that we could not make good use of for statistical operations (regression, etc). This program was a hail mary to get us the data that we needed on literally the due date.
## This project leverages the following libraries:
pandas, numpy, statsmodels
## This project does not require any special setup steps.

## The expected frequency for running this code is as follows:
As Needed
